# Flutter Medical UI

This is the **development/v1** branch, the improvements that have been made include:

1. Creating a start page that contains a brief explanation of the application.
2. Creating a home page that contains the user's name and a list of available doctors.

## Reference

In the UI slicing process I took design references from the [YouTube](https://youtu.be/u3Fq3xZqpz4?si=bYlf_sRbPohHBiWW) platform.
